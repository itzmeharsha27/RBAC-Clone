# Schedulo - A Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System for Managing and Scheduling Classes for Teachers
![Demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdde407f-ab98-4473-b912-ab5280841e9f)

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for Schedulo, a modern scheduling and management system for colleges. Built with React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend, it facilitates the administration of class schedules, teacher assignments, and student management. It incorporates Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to provide secure access for different users, including Admins, Teachers, and Students.

The system is designed to:
- **Manage Class Schedules**: Admins (Head of Department) can assign teachers to classes and manage class schedules.
- **RBAC Implementation**: A secure role-based access system where users are granted permissions based on their roles (Admin, Teacher, Student).
- **Teacher Availability**: Teachers can view their schedules, request changes, and see which classes they are assigned to.
- **User Management**: Admins can add, modify, or delete users and manage their roles and permissions.
## Test Deployed App
- **Issues**:
  - The app is currently experiencing an issue with the frontend accessing cookies from the backend in the Render deployment. This will be corrected soon.
  - Responses are delayed due to limited resources in the free-tier hosting. Please be patient while performing operations during testing, as it might take some time to receive a response.
  - All pages are functioning properly; however, rerouting has some issues with the hosting platform. This will also be addressed soon.

## Features

### 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

The system is built with a robust **Role-Based Access Control** to manage the access levels of different users. Each user is assigned one of the following roles:

- **Admin (HOD)**: Can manage schedules, approve/reject changes, assign teachers to classes, manage user roles, and perform administrative tasks.
- **Teacher**: Can view their schedule, request schedule changes, and manage their own profile.
- **Student**: Can view class schedules and teachers assigned to each class.

#### Role Flow and Permissions:

| Role      | Permissions                                                             |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Admin** | Can view, modify, delete schedules, manage users, assign teachers.       |
| **Teacher** | Can view their schedule, request changes, and manage own profile.    |
| **Student** | Can view class schedules and their assigned teachers.                 |

### 2. **Scheduling System**

The **Admin** (Head of Department) can assign teachers to various periods of the day, taking into account the availability of teachers. If a teacher is unavailable, the Admin can see that information and ensure that there are no scheduling conflicts.

### 3. **Teacher Assignment**

Teachers are dynamically assigned to classes based on the schedules. The system allows for:
- Viewing of schedules by teachers.
- Assigning teachers to specific time slots for particular classes.
- Removing or changing teacher assignments.

### 4. **Search and Filter**

A comprehensive **search and filter** system is implemented for schedules. Admins can filter by day, class, or teacher to view specific schedules quickly.

### 5. **User Management**

Admins can:
- Create, modify, and delete users.
- Assign roles (Admin, Teacher, Student) to users.
- Restrict access based on roles and permissions.

### 6. **Responsive Design**

The system uses a **responsive design**, ensuring that the application is fully functional across devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

- Viewing teacher assignments.
- Assigning teachers to free periods using the "Plus" button.
- Deleting existing assignments.

### 2. **Sidebar Component**
The sidebar provides navigation between various parts of the application:
- Dashboard
- Schedules

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- MongoDB installed and running
- Node.js and npm installed

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/college-scheduling-system.git
   cd college-scheduling-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables in `.env` file:
   ```bash
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/schedule_db
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Import Collation Data
   The project includes a `RBAC.zip` file containing JSON files for initializing MongoDB collections. Follow these steps to import the data:

   a. Extract the `RBAC.zip` file
   
   b. Use MongoDB's `mongoimport` utility to import the collections:
   ```bash
   # Make sure you're in the directory containing the JSON files
   
   # Import Users Collection
   mongoimport --db schedule_db --collection users --file users.json --jsonArray
   
   # Import Schedules Collection
   mongoimport --db schedule_db --collection schedules --file schedules.json --jsonArray
   
   # Import Roles Collection
   mongoimport --db schedule_db --collection roles --file roles.json --jsonArray
   ```

   Note: Replace `schedule_db` with the database name specified in your `MONGODB_URI` if different.

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Running Both Backend and Frontend
You can run both the backend and frontend concurrently using tools like **Nodemon** for the backend and the default React development server for the frontend.

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure MongoDB is running before launching the application
- Verify that all JSON files from `RBAC.zip` are imported correctly
- Check that environment variables are correctly set
- Confirm that all dependencies are installed
